# Welcome to ProjectHype!
</center>
ProjectHype is a coding language where you can turn your code into a App or a Website! (Hopefully)

Example Code (Hypescript): 



```python
!@import hypegathers;

{function: "donothing"}: [
    {set text with gather: "bigtext" to: "Very Big Text!"}
]
```

(The Color isn't what it would actually look like btw.)

# How ProjectHype Started:
ProjectHype actually started out as a Project that [@Toastyzz0](https://github.co/Toastyzz0) made for fun. Then, it turned into a Youtube Video (Not out rn.) and then, it turned into a fun project.

Most Files you see (main.hype, looks.hyl, etc) is just a test. 

# FAQ:
"Will Hype be added to things like [Visual Studios Code](https://vscode.dev),  [Jetbrain's Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), And others?"

Depending. If they want to add it then, my answer is Sure!

"Is there an Extention for Hype that can support things like [Visual Studios Code](https://vscode.dev)?"

Nope. I don't have any plans to add them but, I might in the Future.
